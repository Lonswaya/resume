> ## Senior Software Engineer

> I am an engineer currently in the Indianapolis area, soon to move to central Colorado. Aurora Innovation is a company that has a lot of potential, both to create amazing technology key to our future and to challenge my technical skills to the next level. I would be pleased to find a place for myself with your company.

> As a Senior Software Engineer, my technical insight spans across a variety of different projects. My history includes (but is not limited to) C++/Linux Automotive Self-Driving Tractor Software, Android OS (C++) & native app (Java) development, and my latest project has been developing a website using React and Remix with Typescript for web development. 

> Most importantly, I have a great understanding of what it takes to build complicated software in a team. I've taken a larger role as a Senior Engineer, assuming a technical lead role. I've investigated technical challenges and conducted platform research. I've taken complicated concepts and communicated difficult concepts to teammates from all backgrounds, while future-proofing the work we've done. I've also taken initiative with team organization: from stakeholder communication to user story mapping, I have the skills required to guide a team and fulfill complicated software requirements.

> I'm always open for a challenging and interesting opportunity, so if you have an opening for a position within my skill set, please let me know.
